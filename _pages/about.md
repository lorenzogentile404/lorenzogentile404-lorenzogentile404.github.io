I am currently working as a Research Engineer at [Consensys](https://consensys.io/), specifically as part of the [Linea](https://linea.build/) team.
I hold a PhD in Cryptography from [IT University of Copenhagen](https://www.itu.dk/) (ITU), where I had the chance to be supervised by [Bernardo David](https://www.bmdavid.com/), join the [Center for Information Security and Trust](https://cist.dk/) (CISAT) and collaborate as Scientific Partner with [Concordium](https://concordium.com/). Moreover, within my PhD studies, I visited [TU Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/) for one semester, where I had the chance to be supervised by [Sebastian Faust](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fb20/organisation_fb20/professuren_und_gruppenleitungen/fb20professuren_und_gruppenleitungen_detailseite_80576.en.jsp) and join [CROSSING](https://www.crossing.tu-darmstadt.de/crc_1119/index.en.jsp). Here you find my [PhD thesis](https://lorenzogentile404.github.io/files/phd_thesis.pdf) and the deck of [slides](https://lorenzogentile404.github.io/files/phd_thesis_slides.pdf) I used for my defence.    

I hold a Master in Computer Engineering from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/) (PoliMi) and I have previously worked on research projects at the Department of Mathematics of PoliMi, [Osservatori Digital Innovation](https://www.osservatori.net/) and at the Business IT Department of ITU. 

Beyond that, I worked for two years at [Moxoff](https://www.moxoff.com/), that is a PoliMi spin-off aimed at transfering results of applied mathematics research (in particular related to mathematical optimization and statistics) to industry, and as a Freelance Software Engineer.

My current research interests focus on cryptographic protocols for multiparty computation and blockchain applications.
